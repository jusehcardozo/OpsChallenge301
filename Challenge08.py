# Author: Jose Cardozo
# Date of latest version:  12/21/2022
# Purpose: Use lists and sets.

# I used this link to get instructions on how to do this:
# https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-ops-301d7/blob/main/class-09/challenges/DEMO.md

# Create a Python script that includes the following:

# Assign to a variable a list of ten string elements.
fruitlist = ["blue", "orange", "green", "red", "black", "pink", "yellow", "white", "brown", "purple"]
print(fruitlist)

# Print the fourth element of the list.

fruitlist = ["blue", "orange", "green", "red", "black", "pink", "yellow", "white", "brown", "purple"]
print(fruitlist[3])

# Print the sixth through tenth element of the list.

fruitlist = ["blue", "orange", "green", "red", "black", "pink", "yellow", "white", "brown", "purple"]
print(fruitlist[5:9])

# Change the value of the seventh element to "onion".

fruitlist[6] = "onion"
print(fruitlist)

# yeeehaw!
